<h2> Short description </h2>
This program gives possibility to use symmetric and asymmetric cryptography methods and creates a simple service with API (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and endpoints. User can encrypt and decrypt message. It uses Python Cryptography library that includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests, and key derivation functions (https://cryptography.io/en/latest/).
